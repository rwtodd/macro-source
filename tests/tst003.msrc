Let's pass some globals around (passing 4).
@.(pass a number (2+2))
And see if it's 4...
  @.(read the number)
Did it work?

Ok, now let's pass a number to a function with a signature...
@.(pass another number (2+3))
  @.(read the number)
Was it 5?

@./pass a number/p
$globals{number} = shift;
@.

@./pass another number ($n)/p
$globals{number} = $n;
@.

@./read the number/p
push @result, "$globals{number}";
@.
