Let's set up the global... to 100
@./()/l
number = 100
@.
Did it work?  @.(read the number)

Ok, Let's pass some globals around (passing 4).
@.(pass a number (2+2))
And see if it's 4...
  @.(read the number)
Did it work?

Ok, now let's pass a number to a function with a signature...
@.(pass another number (2+3))
  @.(read the number)
Was it 5?

@./pass a number (n)/l
number = n
@.

@./pass another number (n)/l
number = n
@.

@./read the number ()/l
table.insert(result, number)
@.
